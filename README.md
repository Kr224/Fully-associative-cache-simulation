This project is a fully associative cache simulator designed to mimic the behavior of a cache memory system. It provides a platform to understand cache operations and analyze cache hit and miss rates under different scenarios.

Features:
Fully Associative Cache: Implements a fully associative cache structure where any block can be placed in any cache line.
Cache Operations: Simulates cache read and write operations, including cache hits and misses.
Statistics: Tracks cache hit rate, miss rate, and other relevant metrics for performance analysis.
Configurability: Easily configurable parameters such as cache size, block size, and replacement policy.
